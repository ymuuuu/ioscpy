## Host (Rust)
host:
	cd host && cargo build

host-release:
	cd host && cargo build --release

install:
	./install.sh

# No host-release dependency on purpose: this target is usually run with sudo,
# and root's PATH does not see a rustup-installed cargo. Build as your user
# first (`make host-release`), then install.

	@echo "installed ioscpy -> $(PREFIX)/bin/ioscpy"

uninstall-host:

fmt:

clippy:
	cd host && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

test:
	cd host && cargo test

## Device (Theos). FINALPACKAGE=1 builds clean release .deb files (no debug
## suffix), which is what gets installed and shipped.
device-rootless:
	cd device && $(MAKE) package THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME=rootless FINALPACKAGE=1

device-rootful:
	cd device && $(MAKE) package FINALPACKAGE=1

device-roothide:
	# Needs the roothide Theos fork installed (THEOS with the roothide scheme);
	# a plain Theos falls back to a rootful build, which won't load on roothide.
	cd device && $(MAKE) package THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME=roothide FINALPACKAGE=1

device: device-rootless

## Packaging

## Combined
